3.  how will success be measured?
4.  what alternatives exist?
5.  why now?
6.  how will solution be deployed?
7.  preliminary estimated cost or budget?
8.  what are critical success factors?

Low Fidelity Prototype (optional):  paper based, or extremely high-level click through prototype of system.
