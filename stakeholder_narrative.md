## The Stakeholder View of our Process

This page describes the various pieces of how Domain7 builds custom web 
applications, from the point of view of a stakeholder.

We'll begin by defining, in very simple terms, the overall philosophy that
(we believe) makes Domain7's approach to software development work.
Then we'll define roles more precisely, and continue with project
structure and practices, from the overall view down to the day-to-day.
