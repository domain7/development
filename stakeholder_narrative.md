## The Stakeholder View of our Process

This page describes the various pieces of how Domain7 builds custom web 
applications, from the point of view of a stakeholder.

We'll begin by defining, in very simple terms, the overall philosophy that
(we believe) makes Domain7's approach to software development work.
Then we'll define roles more precisely, and continue with project
structure and practices, from the overall view down to the day-to-day.

## Roles

{% include stakeholder.md %}

{% include project_sponsor.md %}

## Iterations and Stories

The most important concepts in our process are *iterations* (the unit of planning and delivery)
and *stories* (the unit of estimation, development, and tracking).

{% include iterations.md %}

## Meetings

We try not to spend time in meetings unless the meeting is really
necessary, but of course some kinds of communication are best done
in meetings.  These are the kinds of meetings that occur regularly
on a Relevance project:
