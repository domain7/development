#### Types of Projects

  Examples: PN Rail, Eagle West - Crane Tools, Benefic, CLAC Training and Career Services, Carsumer, Mystery Shopping

##### API development

  Do you have information that could be integrated with other existing or yet-to-be-developed software? An Application Programming Interface can free your data in a safe and secure way, reducing the risks of Vendor lock-in. When done correctly API's can also have value to non-technologists, by showing what information is available within an organization.

  Examples: CLAC Training and Career Services

##### Systems integration

  Connect existing in-use software systems or database to new web applications. 

  Integrate with existing software vendor datasources such as Directory Services (i.e. ActiveDirectory, LDAP) or relational Databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, DB2.

  Examples: Eagle West - Crane Tools and Quote App, Benefic, CLAC Wellness, Training and Career Services, Carsumer, Sensus, Mystery Shopping, Sensus

##### Data migration

  Move data from a legacy system into a new web based system.

  Examples: Eagle West, Benefic

##### Cloud based website hosting

  Harness the power of cloud based hosting solutions and allow your IT department to do what they do best.
  
##### Concepting and prototyping

  Examples: Eagle West, KYA

##### Mobile website

  What does your website look like on your smartphone?
  Reaching your clients on the web is quickly meaning more than just the desktop computer bound by latitude and longitude. A website can be viewed on tablets, smart phones and laptops on the move.  

  Mobile: Portable devices with easy access to the internet via wifi or cellular networks.
  
  Mobile Website: Mobile devices can install native applications from "app stores" that tie into native functionality like geolocation and the accelerometer. Did you know that you can visit websites on your mobile device that have lots of the same functionality? These mobile websites can be developed for many platforms and for some uses, much cheaper.
  

##### Existing web application re-writes

  Do you need a more agile development experience? Sometimes moving to a more dynamic and agile technology platform is needed to enable a more agile software development environment. This is a large undertaking, that we have experience in navigating successfully.
