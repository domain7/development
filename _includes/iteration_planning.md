### Iteration Planning {#iteration_planning}

Preceding each iteration, is a planning iteration involving designers and business analysts. 

In this iteration we engage in a planning exercise with the
product owner and other interested customer representatives.
The user stories and feature files that are to be the focus of the new iteration are
chosen from the pool of cards remaining.

As part of this exercise, Domain7 provides initial estimates of how much work we think
is involved in each card, in points.
The customer's role is to assign priorities to the cards, and then to choose the cards that
should be worked on during the next iteration.
