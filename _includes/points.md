### Story Points {#points}

Our story and task estimates are not expressed in hours or days; they're expressed in *points*.
This acknowledges the inevitability of error in estimates, and of varying productivity,
helping to avoid mismatches in expectations between Domain7 and our customers.

Points and velocity are vital concepts.

Velocity: the number of estimated points that we achieve in a single iteration.

Agile uses game theory to optimize performance. Each sprint has a time limit (constant). Every story is “scored” with “points” by developers. This assigns a complexity factor to each story. The points are unitless; they don’t map to anything, they are just points. But based on empirical evidence from past sprints, we know how many points are completed in each sprint. And, from research, the number of points should stay pretty constant (given constant resources). Points per Sprint is called “Velocity.” Think of points as a “cost” factor. Each sprint, the project stakeholders get to “buy” the stories in the sprint, but they are limited in the number of points they can assign — to the “velocity.” Thus you have a budget on a limited resource. From then, developers organize themselves and their workflow to deliver the stories within the time period.

What matters the most during the project is not the granular point-by-point velocity. Instead it is how fast we're moving iteration-by-iteration, moving toward getting the project complete.

### Point values {#point_values}

As stories get larger, we have much less confidence in our estimates.
It's more difficult to grasp the full requirements,
and to think about all of the implementation pieces that will be required.
That means it's also easier for unknown complexities or problems to lurk in such tasks.
So as the size of the task grows, we force the estimates to fit a coarser granularity,
acknowledging the greater likelihood of error.

Bugs are are not assigned points to contribute to velocity, they are technical debt accumulated by poor design or requirements.

Bugs are are not assigned points to contribute to velocity. These are infrastructure related duties that do not contribute business value to the customer. The less time spent on infrastructure, the more working software is delivered.

### Velocity {#velocity}

The number of points that are targeted for work in the new iteration is based on the *velocity*
from prior iterations: the number of estimated points that were actually achieved during those iterations.
The notion of velocity helps us to calibrate the combination of our productivity and
our estimation skill, both of which are variable in specific instances, but mostly stable
in aggregate.
That means, after the first iteration or two, we can make fairly accurate predictions
of how much work can be done over a certain period of time, allowing the customer to budget
and plan more easily.
