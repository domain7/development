## Project Management Practices {#project_management_practices}

Domain7 uses a modified agile development methodology for ensuring development quality, timeliness and utility.
The components of our development strategy have been honed over years of experience;
however, our methods are flexible enough to suit the needs of a variety of different kinds of clients.
We will tailor our approach to each new project as necessary.

### Lifecycle

A development engagement with Domain7 consists of a series of iterations,
and follows these general lifecycle stages:

* Iteration 0:
  An initial period of 2-10 days where the team establishes the development
  and testing environment, including project management and code repositories,
  staging services and databases, etc.
  Also, Business Analysis commences such that enough stories are in place
  to keep the development team busy for a full iteration.
* Iterations 1 - N:
  Development iterations, two weeks in length.
  At the beginning of each iteration we hold an iteration planning meeting
  to choose the highest priority functionality to be addressed.
  At the end of each iteration is a walkthrough of what was accomplished,
  as well as the delivery of a deployable application.  
* Final Iteration:
  Final wrap up of the functionality and deployment of the system
  to the production environment.
* Support Phase:
  Domain7 works with the customer to deal with issues after the
  deployment of the application, addressing newly discovered defects or
  performance enhancements as needed.

### Communication

The most important part of any development process is the management of communication amongst the entire team, from developers to business analysts to beta customers and beyond.
We value communication above all else in our partnerships.
But communication doesn't just happen; therefore, we have many opportunities
for communication built into the structure of the project:

* user stories document (google docs).
* and of course, emails and phone calls when things are unclear.

You will read more detail about all of those during the rest of this document.

### Project Tracking

We use [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com) as our Project Management repository and living documentation source.
Requirements are documented as "User Stories" and represented as stories within Pivotal Tracker.
Each card has a title, a description, and relates to a feature_file, and an estimate of complexity.
Comments, changes, and research are all captured directly on the card.
As we proceed through iterations, cards are pulled in to the iteration as their priority dictates.

### Living Documentation

In addition to user stories and feature files themselves, we also use Google Docs to capture user stories at a high level.
We use Google Docs to keep documentation about architecture, system design.
