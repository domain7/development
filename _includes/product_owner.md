### Product Owner {#product_owner}

The role of the Product Owner is primarily that of a decision maker that protects the quality of the product throughout the project.

#### Role Fluidity

The Product Owner role at Domain7 is fluid throughout the project. It varies between the customer and Domain7 stakeholders. It can be fluid amongst the customer stakeholders. Sometimes, this is the case if the Project Sponsor has appointed another individual act as a Product Owner. In our experience complete Product Ownership cannot be wholly appointed.

##### Domain7 or Customer filled role?
The role ideally resides on the customer side. However, this is not always possible.
Very early in the project the Product Owner role is sometimes filled by a person on the Domain7 side. The Domain7 Product Owner will primarily focus on product planning and establishing a model for what aspects of the product and project need clear product ownership. 

As the product matures the importance of the Domain7 Product Owner will diminish and instead focus on:

* Informing the customer Product Owner with all the information necessary
* Late in the project they will serve is an advocate for the customer product owner 

#### A product owner does:

##### Product Planning

Planning at the following levels:

* Product
* Project
* Release
* Iteration
* User Story

##### User Acceptance

* Verify stories are done based on acceptance criteria

Sometimes (often very early in the project) the Product Owner on the Domain7 side may be navigating the risks of user acceptance on behalf of the client. This is not ideal and should be as short lived as possible. 

Reasons it is sometimes necessary to have internal user acceptance:

* The current sprints are focussed on getting the application to a sensible, initial user flow
* The current sprint is a part of a larger Big Story and acceptance of the Big Story will serve as a sufficient user acceptance

This is base on feedback form our clients, that being involved too much in user acceptance early in the project was not needed.
