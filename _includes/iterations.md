### Iterations {#iterations}

Domain7 projects are structured in two-week iterations.
For each iteration, a set of stories is selected that we believe can
be developed during the two weeks.
Then, during the 5 days of the iteration, those cards will be developed methodically,
according to the priorities selected by the project sponsor.

As the cards are developed and delivered for the customer, they are accepted by the product owner, ideally within 24 hours of delivery.
At the end of the iteration (and possibly during the iteration if it will not be too disruptive),
the new features will be delivered to staging.
Finally, if the customer has more requirements and wants to continue the project,
the next iteration is planned.
