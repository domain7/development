### Iterations {#iterations}

Domain7 projects are structured in one week iterations.
For each iteration, a set of stories is selected that we believe can
be developed during the two weeks.
Then, during the 5 days of the iteration, those cards will be developed methodically,
according to the priorities selected by the project sponsor.

As the cards are developed and delivered for the customer, they are accepted by the product owner, ideally within 24 hours of delivery.
At the end of the iteration (and possibly during the iteration if it will not be too disruptive),
the new features will be delivered to staging.
Finally, if the customer has more requirements and wants to continue the project,
the next iteration is planned.

### Embedded Design

Each iteration is preceded by planning. Sometimes this is a "planning sprint". At Domain7 we take this time to allow developers and designers to collaborate around fundamental user interface considerations. We also collect and deliver the proper resources that are needed for the developers to use during their next sprint. Resources that may be delivered are:

* Sitemaps
* Page Wireframes
* Page Templates
* Resource Templates
* Layouts
* UX Guideline Documents
