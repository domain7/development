### Iterations {#iterations}

Domain7 projects are structured in one week iterations.
For each iteration, a set of stories is selected that we believe can be completed during the iteration.
Then, during the 5 days of the iteration, those cards will be developed methodically,
according to the priorities selected by the project sponsor.

As the user stories are developed and delivered for the customer, they are accepted by the product owner, ideally within 24 hours of delivery.

Finally, if the customer has more requirements and wants to continue the project,
the next iteration is planned.

### Embedded Design

Each iteration is preceded by planning. Sometimes this is a "planning sprint". At Domain7 we take this time to allow developers and designers to collaborate around fundamental user interface considerations. We also collect and deliver the proper resources that are needed for the developers to use during their next sprint. Resources that may be delivered are:

* Sitemaps
* Page Wireframes
* Page Templates
* Resource Templates
* Layouts
* UX Guideline Documents

By embedding design in the development process we reduce the need to come back and "make this look good". This helps user acceptance by not forcing the product owner to see past design (or lack of design) elements that may change in the future. It also reduces the need for developers to make their own design decisions independent of one another, and possibly not in accordance with the overall design vision.
