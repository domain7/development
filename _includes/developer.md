### Developer {#developer}

The developer writes code. At Domain7, we do not call out separate "design" or "architect" roles. Developers architect, and architects code.

Developers employ the following practices:

* ux design
* pair programming (remote and co-located)
* behaviour driven development
* code review
* distributed source control
* audits
* story delivery
* code refactoring
