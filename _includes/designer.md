### Designer {#designer}

The designer directs the way the website looks. They also work closely with developers to direct how the website behaves. 

Designers employ the following practices:

* content based design
* information architecture design
* interaction design
* user experience design
* application design

The design process may involve the development of the following deliverables:

* flow charts and site maps
* wireframes and interactive prototypes
* visual design and layout concepts
* templates for implementation and application integration

At Domain7, designers also collaborate with developers to guide how an application behaves and invokes interaction from users.
